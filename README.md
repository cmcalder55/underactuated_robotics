# Underactuated Robotic Gripper
Underactuated robotic gripper research performed through the Advanced Robot Manipulators Laboratory at Stevens Institute of Technology under the guidance of Dr. Long Wang. View the lab webpage here: https://longwang.in/

BACKGROUND: This project was focused on creating a low-cost robotic hand that can be attached to a commercial robotic arm for various complex manipulation tasks. The main feature of the design is the underactuation system, meaning multiple joints can be controlled by one mechanism. Inspired by human biology, tendon-driven underactuation is used to control 8 finger joints using only 2 motors. Sensor feedback and computer vision is then used to optimize grasping.  
The manipulator can be positioned and commanded directly by a user. The manipulator uses force and angle sensors to optimize its grasp. Tasks can also be performed autonomously using sensor feedback and computer vision for better object detection and perception.  

SIMULATION: First, a SolidWorks model of the robotic hand was created.
